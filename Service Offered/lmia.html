            <h1>Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA)</h1>
            <p>
                An LMIA is a document in Canada that evaluates the effect of hiring a foreign worker on the local job
                market. A positive LMIA shows a need for a foreign worker because no local candidates are available.

                        A Visitor Visa, also known as a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) or tourist visa, is an official
                        document placed in your passport by a Canadian visa office to show that you meet the
                        requirements to enter Canada as a temporary resident. Visitors can enter Canada for various
                        purposes, such as tourism, family visits, or business activities. Most visitors can stay in
                        Canada for up to 6 months. Visitors are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents, but they
                        are legally authorized to enter Canada temporarily. The length of stay is typically 6 months,
                        but the border services officer at the port of entry may adjust this duration based on
                        individual circumstances. Visitors may also receive a visitor record, which outlines the date
                        they are required to leave.

                            may allow a shorter or longer stay based on individual circumstances.</li>

                            may

                            Visa?<br><strong>A:</strong>
                            No, a Visitor Visa does not allow you to work or study in Canada. If you wish to work or

                            time?<br><strong>A:</strong>
                            If you overstay your visa, you may be subject to penalties, including removal from
                            Canada or a ban from entering in the future. Itâ€™s crucial to comply with the conditions of
                            your visa.</li>

                            Visa?<br><strong>A:</strong>
                            Yes, you can apply to extend your stay while in Canada if you want to remain longer.

                            Some applicants are required to provide biometrics (fingerprints and a photo) as part of the
                            application process. You will be notified if you need to provide biometrics.</li>

                        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Q:</strong> Can I visit Canada multiple times with the same
                            Visitor Visa?<br><strong>A:</strong>
                            A Visitor Visa is typically valid for a single entry or multiple entries, depending on the
                            visa
                            issued. You can apply for multiple-entry visas if you plan to visit Canada more than once.
